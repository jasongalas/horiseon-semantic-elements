# Horiseon Semantic Elements

## Description

Provided with a base HTML and CSS file, the task was to add semantic elements to the index.html, then in turn clean up and update the CSS file. The goal is to instill a practice of both simplyifing code and making it more accessible, while also increasing its chances of being ranked higher by Google. Using semantic terms in the index.html file makes it easier to parse through, and simplyifing the CSS helps cut down repetition and makes it run more efficiently. For me, being able to see what changes affected which sections of the website helped me understand what aspects could be consolidated together and just how easily a file can be thrown out of balance.

## Installation

After creating a repo in GitHub and cloning it to my machine, I moved the assets from Module 1 into the cloned repo and made my modifications. I did a couple of commits, in part to ensure that the commits were functioning correctly.

## Usage

The given screenshot was the benchmark we were supposed to maintain. The live link matches the screenshot perfectly even after all the edits done to the HTML and CSS files. Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png

## Credits

I gleaned a lot of help from the speedrun that was given to us by our instructor Drew: https://zoom.us/rec/play/wa50Q_7cTmd2Z5F9wIfLCYANtPpIJJa6-UfJEbQIGz17opMQWLXwoF9nbp8dV7fhlXvh8N3HBGxdmoKq.TE6jiZXwklC_q0Vr?canPlayFromShare=true&from=share_recording_detail&startTime=1650865062000&componentName=rec-play&originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FFOZjQ8Uhb-fUF6eR4n_ZBDrhvEmE8quED0lJ3xMgy-r8iVtfmpEfC_TuOvQW8WSp.ozvDTCOZr7RQbhw3%3FstartTime%3D1650865062000
